# Exploring Python Concepts

This repository contains my first Python assignment completed as part of the Cognizant externship program. It includes three short exercises focused on foundational Python concepts: variables, operators, and conditional statements.

## What's Included

### Task 1: Variables  
Introduced a fictional basketball player using variables for name, age, and height. This task was a quick intro to working with different data types and formatting output.

### Task 2: Operators  
Performed basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using two numbers. Each operation is followed by a clear print statement that explains the result.

### Task 3: Conditional Statements  
Built a number checker that prompts the user for input and uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` to identify whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

## How to Run

Make sure Python 3 is installed, then run the file:
python main.py


## Notes

- Developed using Visual Studio Code
- Part of the "Exploring Python Concepts" assignment for the Cognizant externship
- The goal of this repo is to demonstrate clarity and fundamentals, not complexity
